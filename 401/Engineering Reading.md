## What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
This might sound like such a cliche answer but I strongly believe it is passion. I cant speak for others but for me programming is not about the potential of the huge salary but soley because I just enjoy it so much. From all my time coding I can confidently say I have enjoyed literally every second of it. Even the difficult parts.

## What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
1. Take a break. I tend to find myself stuck and spinning my wheels in the same spot for awhile. Sometimes stepping back and giving yourself a break can show you a new perspective.
2. Stay hydrated better. I know personally I will find myself coding for hours on end and not think about eating or drinking water. Before I know it I can feel the dehydration catching up to me. Keeping my mind and body healthy is a great way to stay on top of my game.
3. Collaborate more. Sometimes I dont know the answer and that is okay. Maybe someone else can give me an insight I have overlooked or teach me something new that can make me an even better developer!
