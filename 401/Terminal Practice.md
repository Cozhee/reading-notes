## The Command Line
The command line is a text based interface used on a computer! You will be given a prompt to enter your commands into this thing called bash! Short for Bourne again shell.

## Basic Navigation
A simple command you can type is `pwd` and this will print to your terminal the current path you are located in. You also have the `ls` command that will print to the terminal everything in your current directory! There is another basic command `cd` that allows you to jump forward and backwards to other directories.

## More About Files
First thing first. Everything is a file! From your actual files, the folders they are in, your keyboard and even your monitor are files! Files can have extensions that will specify what type of file it is such as `.png`, `.txt`, `.jpg` and many more.

## Manual Pages
It is hard enough to remember everything we read. Thankfully we have a help menu, known as the manual pages that will list all of the commands we can type in our terminal. You simply type `man <your command to look up>` and you will receive instructions in your terminal how to use the command you are curious about. 

## File Manipulation
Within your terminal you can create files, move files or even delete them. These commands are easy to use and easy to remember. If you would like to make a new directory all you need to type is `mkdir <name>` and boom you have a new directory! Typing `touch <name>` will create a blank file as well in your current directory. Removing a directory is as easy as `rmdir <name>` and moving is just `mv <source><destination>`!
