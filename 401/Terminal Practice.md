## The Command Line
The command line is a text based interface used on a computer! You will be given a prompt to enter your commands into this thing called bash! Short for Bourne again shell.

## Basic Navigation
A simple command you can type is `pwd` and this will print to your terminal the current path you are located in. You also have the `ls` command that will print to the terminal everything in your current directory! There is another basic command `cd` that allows you to jump forward and backwards to other directories.

## More About Files
First thing first. Everything is a file! From your actual files, the folders they are in, your keyboard and even your monitor are files! Files can have extensions that will specify what type of file it is such as `.png`, `.txt`, `.jpeg` and many more.
