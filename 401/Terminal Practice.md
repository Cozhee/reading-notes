## The Command Line
The command line is a text based interface used on a computer! You will be given a prompt to enter your commands into this thing called bash! Short for Bourne again shell.

## Basic Navigation
A simple command you can type is `pwd` and this will print to your terminal the current path you are located in. You also have the `ls` command that will print to the terminal everything in your current directory! There is another basic command `cd` that allows you to jump forward and backwards to other directories.
